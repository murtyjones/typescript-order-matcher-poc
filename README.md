# TypeScript Order Matcher Proof-of-Concept

## What is this repository???

This repository implements a proof-of-concept order matching engine in TypeScript.

This is an educational project, and TypeScript was chosen for ease of reading and ease of writing. In reality, you wouldn't use such a high-level language to implement order matching, because the performance and control of a lower-level language (e.g. Rust, C/C++) is much better suited to this purpose. In short, don't try and use this project for a real order matching engine, but do try and learn from this project before implementing your own.

## Okay, so what's an order matching engine?
